    "Q1. **What is the Probability density function?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability density function (PDF) is a function that describes the likelihood of a continuous random variable taking on a particular value. It gives the probability of the variable falling within a particular range of values, rather than at a specific point. The integral of the PDF over a range gives the probability that the random variable falls within that range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. **What are the types of Probability distribution?**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of probability distributions, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Normal Distribution**: Describes a symmetrical, bell-shaped curve.\n",
    "- **Binomial Distribution**: Models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.\n",
    "- **Poisson Distribution**: Models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.\n",
    "- **Uniform Distribution**: All outcomes are equally likely.\n",
    "- **Exponential Distribution**: Describes the time between events in a Poisson process.\n",
    "- **Chi-Square Distribution**: Arises in tests of statistical significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. **Write a Python function to calculate the probability density function of a normal distribution with given mean and standard deviation at a given point.**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "def normal_pdf(x, mean, std_dev):\n",
    "    coefficient = 1 / (std_dev * np.sqrt(2 * np.pi))\n",
    "    exponent = -0.5 * ((x - mean) / std_dev) ** 2\n",
    "    return coefficient * np.exp(exponent)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. **What are the properties of Binomial distribution? Give two examples of events where binomial distribution can be applied.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Properties of the Binomial distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It models the number of successes (e.g., heads in coin flips, successes in trials) out of a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.\n",
    "- It has two parameters: the number of trials (n) and the probability of success on each trial (p).\n",
    "- The mean of a Binomial distribution is \\( \\mu = np \\) and the variance is \\( \\sigma^2 = np(1-p) \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of events where Binomial distribution can be applied:\n",
    "1. Tossing a coin multiple times and counting the number of heads.\n",
    "2. Conducting a series of medical tests and counting the number of positive results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. **Generate a random sample of size 1000 from a binomial distribution with probability of success 0.4 and plot a histogram of the results using matplotlib.**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "# Generate random sample\n",
    "sample = np.random.binomial(n=1, p=0.4, size=1000)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Plot histogram\n",
    "plt.hist(sample, bins=2, density=True, alpha=0.7)\n",
    "plt.xlabel('Outcome')\n",
    "plt.ylabel('Probability')\n",
    "plt.title('Histogram of Binomial Distribution')\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. **Write a Python function to calculate the cumulative distribution function of a Poisson distribution with given mean at a given point.**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from scipy.stats import poisson\n",
    "\n",
    "def poisson_cdf(x, mean):\n",
    "    return poisson.cdf(x, mu=mean)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. **How is Binomial distribution different from Poisson distribution?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main differences between Binomial and Poisson distributions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Number of Trials**: In a Binomial distribution, the number of trials (n) is fixed and finite, while in a Poisson distribution, the number of events is not fixed and can be infinite.\n",
    "- **Probability of Success**: In a Binomial distribution, each trial has a constant probability of success (p), whereas in a Poisson distribution, the probability of an event occurring in a fixed interval is proportional to the length of the interval.\n",
    "- **Shape**: A Binomial distribution tends to be symmetric when \\( np(1-p) \\) is not too small, while a Poisson distribution is skewed to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. **Generate a random sample of size 1000 from a Poisson distribution with mean 5 and calculate the sample mean and variance.**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sample = np.random.poisson(lam=5, size=1000)\n",
    "sample_mean = np.mean(sample)\n",
    "sample_variance = np.var(sample)\n",
    "print(\"Sample Mean:\", sample_mean)\n",
    "print(\"Sample Variance:\", sample_variance)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. **How are mean and variance related in Binomial distribution and Poisson distribution?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Binomial distribution, the mean \\( \\mu \\) and variance \\( \\sigma^2 \\) are related by \\( \\sigma^2 = np(1-p) \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Poisson distribution, both the mean \\( \\lambda \\) and variance \\( \\lambda \\) are equal, i.e., \\( \\sigma^2 = \\lambda \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. **In normal distribution with respect to mean position, where does the least frequent data appear?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In a normal distribution, the least frequent data appears at the tails, which are the extreme ends of the distribution. As you move away from the mean in either direction, the frequency of data points decreases."

    "Data can be categorized into different types based on their nature and characteristics. The main types of data are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Nominal Data:\n",
    "Nominal data, also known as categorical data, consist of categories or labels with no inherent order or ranking. Nominal data can be qualitative or quantitative, but the numbers assigned to categories are arbitrary and do not represent any inherent value or order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \n",
    "Gender (male, female, other), marital status (single, married, divorced), eye color (blue, brown, green) are examples of nominal data. Each category represents a distinct group, but there is no inherent order or numerical significance to the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Ordinal Data:\n",
    "Ordinal data represent categories with a meaningful order or ranking but do not have a consistent unit of measurement or equal intervals between categories. While there is a ranking, the differences between the categories may not be equal or quantifiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Educational attainment (high school diploma, bachelor's degree, master's degree, PhD) is an example of ordinal data. While there is a clear ranking in terms of educational achievement, the difference between each level of education is not necessarily uniform or quantifiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Interval Data:\n",
    "Interval data represent categories with a meaningful order, and the intervals between categories are equal and measurable. However, interval data do not have a true zero point, meaning that zero does not represent the absence of the measured attribute but rather a point on the scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Temperature measured in Celsius or Fahrenheit is an example of interval data. The difference between 20째C and 30째C is the same as the difference between 30째C and 40째C, but zero degrees does not represent the absence of temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Ratio Data:\n",
    "Ratio data are similar to interval data but have a true zero point, which represents the absence of the measured attribute. Ratio data have a meaningful order, equal intervals between categories, and a true zero point, allowing for meaningful ratios and mathematical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Height, weight, and age are examples of ratio data. For example, if someone's height is twice another person's height, it means they are truly twice as tall. Similarly, if someone weighs zero kilograms, it means they have no weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the main types of data are nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio data, each differing in terms of the nature of categories, the presence of order or ranking, and the presence of a true zero point. Understanding the type of data being analyzed is crucial for selecting appropriate statistical methods and interpreting results accurately."
